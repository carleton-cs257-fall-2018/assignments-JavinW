README for file-monitoring-system

This is a scalable monitoring system that sends change information to a remote database. 
It was created during my externship at Crowdstrike. It is coded in Python. It detects 
changes using a Python module called Watchdog, and the information detected is sent to a 
MySQL database using Flask.
