README.txt for Sixflags.java

This is a personal project that I was inspired to create over the summer. The name references 
Six Flags America because I worked there during summer 2018 as a lifeguard and their system
for scheduling people was a bit annoying. I wanted a project that I could work on over the 
summer to keep practicing Java and learn more about the language than I learned in my Data
Structures class. This is an ongoing project that I will be building onto as I continue to 
learn more about Java and software design. 

Currently, this program can read in employees from a text file, create a new employee in the system, 
search through the list of employees and display information about a particular employee, 
write employees to the text file, and quit the program. I am currently working on the schedule
features. They were working originally, but I recently restructured a lot of the program to 
be more efficient. Next I will be adding delete employee and update employee information
features.
