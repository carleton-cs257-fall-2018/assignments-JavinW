README.txt for mazeProject

This was my final project for my Introduction to Computer Science class. I decided to work 
alone on this project like I had on other projects throughout the term. I wanted to work 
with a partner during the term, but my schedule was too busy to accomodate someone else. 
It was the longest project I had done up to that point, so when I finished it and presented 
it to my class, I was super proud of myself and the project. 

This is a maze game written in Python. The game code is located in the file called maze.py. 
It uses Python graphics to create a separate window in which the game is played. The game 
first shows the user some instructions on how to play. Then the user can select which 
maze they want to solve by clicking on an emoji. Finally, the user can play the game using
a computer's arrow keys, and the program will draw the path that the user has taken through
the maze. A timer displays the time remaining to solve the maze. If the user solves the 
maze within the time limit, a meme appears on the screen congratulating the user. If the user
fails, a meme appears on the screen telling them that they have lost.
