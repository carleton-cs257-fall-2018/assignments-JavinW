README for RSACrypto.java

This was an assignment for my Math of Computer Science class. We talked a little bit in 
class about the algorithm for RSA cryptosystems and then got this assignment. We didn't 
have much time to complete it, and people coding in java (like my partner and me) ran into 
an issue with integers. The class found out too late that int was too small to hold the 
numbers that we needed, so we tried to convert all of the ints to BigInt and Longs. Because 
of that, the program sometimes crashes and doesn't quite do everything the way it should.
Eventually I want to rewrite the entire program, but for now this is what my partner and I 
came up with.
