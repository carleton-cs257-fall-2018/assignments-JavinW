README for first-webapp

This is a program that allows users to interact with data through a web app. It was 
created for my Software Design class. The data is originally from the GitHub repository 
fivethirtyeight, and it was loaded into a Postgres database. The rest of the program was 
implemented using Python, Flask, Psycopg2, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
