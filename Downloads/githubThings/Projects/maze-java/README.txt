README for maze-java

This is a program I created as a final project for Software Design. It uses JavaFX
to display a maze that I created to the user. The user guides the piece through the 
maze under a time limit. The final score is calculated based upon the number of moves made
and how much time is left once the piece reaches the end the maze. If the user fails to 
solve it, the winning solution is shown. If the user gives up on solving it, there is an
option to auto-solve the maze. 

This program is an upgrade on my Python maze. The graphics are better, as is the collision
detection.
